# RickAndMortyApp
API practice work with data load from internet to recycler view items using rickandmortyapi.com
In this app, I used technologies such as: retrofit, coroutines, picasso.

Project structure: 1 activity, 2 fragments. First fragment it's list with characters from rick and morty cartoon. Second fragment it's details about selected character from list on first fragment.
